# 🌾 Development of a Data-Driven Crop Advisory System Using Soil and Environmental Parameters

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Design and develop a simple, sensor-assisted or data-driven system that recommends the most suitable crop to cultivate based on soil macronutrients (N, P, K), pH level, temperature, humidity, and rainfall. The system should analyze the current soil and weather conditions to provide accurate crop suggestions and related fertilizer advisory services for small farm holders.

## 💡 Key Features
- Uses machine learning to predict best crop
- Based on parameters: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, temperature, humidity, rainfall
- Trained using a real Kaggle dataset
- Provides real-time crop recommendation
